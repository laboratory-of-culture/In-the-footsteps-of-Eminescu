								<h3>Chernivtsi | street Arona Pumnula, 19 (Aron Pumnul's house)</h3>
								<p>This is the first published poetry of 16-year-old Mihai Eminescu, published in
									brochure "Tears of Chernivtsi high school students on the grave of favorite teacher Aaron
									Pumnula" in 1866. These lines are dedicated to the teacher and mentor of Mihai Eminescu, Aaron Pumnul, with whom the poet has lived since 1865 in a house on Pumnul Street,
									19 and tidied up his library. Pumnul took care of Eminescu, he was able to see his
									talent and in every way helped to develop it, and his ideas and worldview greatly influenced
									young Mihai, who, due to his teacher, realized his Romanian
									identity and soon changed his last name to Eminescu. After the death of Pumnul Eminescu
									left school at the gymnasium, and explained to his father: “I have nothing left
									to do in Chernivtsi. There is no fading - he died ... "</p>

								<h3>Chernivtsi | street Shkil'na, 4 (former primary school where Eminescu studied)</h3>
								<p>The house on Shkilna, 4 previously housed an Orthodox primary school for
									boys, in which Eminescu studied during 1958-60. The future poet went to school
									left at the age of 8 on the instructions of his father. The boy liked to quarrel, often
									spent his time in the present-day St. Mary's Square. Eminescu had the hardest time
									German, which he learned almost all his life. However, Eminescu studied diligently -
									was fifth in the school among 82 students.</p>

								<h3>Chernivtsi | street Main, 14 (former hotel "Moldova")</h3>
								<p>Mihai Eminescu was fond of theater. "Eminescu closely followed that
									took place on stage, - wrote Stefanelli. - He stared at the actors, as if he wanted to absorb
									all the action, all the melodies that sounded in their mouths ... ”. The theater has changed dramatically
									his life. In the spring of 1864 a theatrical troupe arrived in Chernivtsi on tour
									Mihai Pascali and Fanny Tardini. They performed at the Moldavia Hotel near the church
									Saint Paraskeva. Mihai did not miss any of their performances. He was imbued with passion
									to the theater, recited poems, sang songs from their repertoire. Finally, when the theater troupe
									finished touring in the city, he left with them.</p>

								<h3>Bucharest| Strada Piața Amzei 6</h3>
								<p>TIn 1883, Eminescu lived with his friend and colleague from the newspaper "Timpul" Ioan Slavici. This house was located among the boyar houses of Gălășescu, across the road from the entrance to the theater "Ion Creangă". From the window of the house overlooking the square, Eminescu could watch the life of the street and the vendors selling vegetables here. While living here, Eminescu wrote such poems as "Povestea Codrului", "Singurătate", "Pe aceeași ulicioară", "Mai am un singur dor" and all "Letters". Now on the site of that house is a house.</p>

								<h3>Bucharest| strada Plantelor nr.9 (​ sanatoriul doctorului Sutu)</h3>
								<p>This building used to house the Caritas Sanatoriul doctorului Sutu, where Mihai
									Eminescu was treated for syphilis. In fact, at the age of 33 the poet due to fatigue discovered bipolar disorder with manic-depressive symptoms. However, the doctors of that time
									Eminescu was treated for syphilis with the only drug known at the time - mercury. It
									worsened the poet's condition even more, because mercury causes irreversible damage to the nervous system
									cardiovascular systems. And on June 15, 1889, at about 4 am Eminescu
									died. The newspaper "Românul" then wrote "Eminescu is no more". This verse is
									poetic testament to Eminescu. Although the poet was buried in Bella Cemetery in Bucharest, in
									Constanti built a statue of the poet. This is how the poet's wishes were fulfilled - after
									death to be by the sea.</p>

								<h3>Bucharest | Bulevardul General Gheorghe Magheru 9 (memorial plaque)</h3>
								<p>Eminescu lived in the house of Tito Mayorescu, which was previously located on the site of the park
									Arthur Verona Street. This residence also served as a meeting place for Junimia,
									Literary Society and the Masonic Lodge of German rule. They say that in
									Eminescu had a platonic love affair with Mita Kremnitz, the daughter-in-law of the landlord.
									He gave her a notebook with his poems, among which were such masterpieces as
									“Rugăciunea unui dac” and “Atât de fragedă”. Also in this building on April 24, 1882 the poet
									for the first time he read excerpts from the first versions of the poems "Scrisori" and "Luceafărul".</p>
